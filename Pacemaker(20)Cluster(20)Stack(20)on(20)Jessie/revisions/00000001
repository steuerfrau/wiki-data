The result of this was that any packages which are maintained by the Debian-HA-Maintainers team - and which were not ready for migration to testing; were not included in the release of Debian Jessie. This is closely followed by a policy which excludes the aforementioned packages from the Jessie (main) repository permanently.

There is also the clusterlabs developers list
(http://clusterlabs.org/mailman/listinfo/developers), if you want to CC

the list of well supported distros. Please keep up the good work!
