I installed MoinMoin on Debian 8 Jessie using the following steps:

{{{
aptitude install python-moinmoin apache2                                    
}}}
                      
Edit the last two lines of /etc/moin/mywiki.py:
{{{
# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-
# IMPORTANT! This encoding (charset) setting MUST be correct! If you live in a
# western country and you don't know that you use utf-8, you probably want to
# use iso-8859-1 (or some other iso charset). If you use utf-8 (a Unicode
# encoding) you MUST use: coding: utf-8
# That setting must match the encoding your editor uses when you modify the
# settings below. If it does not, special non-ASCII chars will be wrong.

This is a sample config for a wiki that is part of a wiki farm and uses
farmconfig for common stuff. Here we define what has to be different from
the farm's common settings.

# we import the FarmConfig class for common defaults of our wikis:
from farmconfig import FarmConfig

# now we subclass that config (inherit from it) and change what's different:
class Config(FarmConfig):

    # basic options (you normally need to change these)
    sitename = u'MyWiki' # [Unicode]
    interwikiname = u'MyWiki' # [Unicode]

    # name of entry page / front page [Unicode], choose one of those:

    # a) if most wiki content is in a single language
    #page_front_page = u"MyStartingPage"

    # b) if wiki content is maintained in many languages
    page_front_page = u"FrontPage"
